# Arrow
A Micro Unit Testing Framework for C11/C++14 onwards. It's tiny - about 1k lines of code. This framework is a *much* simpler and lighter alternative to Google Test, making it suitable for on-to-go testing. 

Arrow is part of [`CSTL`](https://github.com/jasmcaus/CSTL), a neater rewrite of the C/C++ Standard Library, although active development happens in the [Hazel Programming Language](https://github.com/HazelLang/Hazel) repository and changes are subsequently reflected in the [`CSTL`](https://github.com/jasmcaus/CSTL) repo.

## Installation
None! Arrow is header-only, so simply include it in your project
```c
#include <Arrow/Arrow>
```

## Example Usage
Below is a slightly contrived example showing a number of possible supported operations:
```c
